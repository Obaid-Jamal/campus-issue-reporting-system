Campus Issue Reporting Portal
This is a simple but powerful web application that allows students to report issues on campus (like broken lights, cleanliness problems, etc.) and allows administrators to track, manage, and resolve these issues.
This project is built with a classic, real-world tech stack: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, with a PHP backend and a MySQL database.

🚀 How to Set Up This Project
To run this project on your own computer (or a web server), you'll need a stack like XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP that includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL.
1. Database Setup
1.	Open your database tool (like phpMyAdmin).
2.	Create a new, empty database. Let's say you call it campus_report.
3.	Go to the "SQL" tab and paste the entire contents of the database_setup.sql file (included in this project). This will create all the tables and the default admin user for you.
2. Backend Configuration
1.	Navigate to the api/ folder.
2.	Open the file db_connect.php in a text editor.
3.	Change the database name, username, and password to match your own:
4.	$db = 'campus_report';  // Your database name
5.	$user = 'root';         // Your MySQL username
6.	$pass = '';             // Your MySQL password
3. Folder Permissions
Your PHP script needs to be able to save files (the photos and voice notes).
1.	Find the uploads/ folder in the main project directory.
2.	Give this folder "Write" or "Full Control" permissions. (On Windows, right-click > Properties > Security > Edit).
4. Run the Project
1.	Place the entire project folder (e.g., CampusIssue) inside your web server's root folder (e.g., C:\xampp\htdocs\).
2.	Open your browser and go to http://localhost/CampusIssue/
3.	That's it! You should see the login page.
